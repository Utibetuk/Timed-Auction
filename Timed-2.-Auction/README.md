# TIMED AUCTION

My Dapp has a ton of feautures most remarkably the functions allocated  to the deployer(Auctioner), the auctioner can choose the nft  image, choose a name of his/her choice, set the minimum bid and can start the auction also being able to see the participants  of the  auction and  their  bids. On the participants side they are being prompted to select a bid which must be greater than the minimun  bid and once the timer is up the highest bid wins the bid and everyone including the auctioner  sees that.
